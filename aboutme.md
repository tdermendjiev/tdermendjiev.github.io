My name is Teodor Dermendjiev. I'm a software engineer at [Azbouki](https://www.azbouki.com/), a startup focused on developer tools for mobile developers. I have a master degree of Law and care a lot about digital human rights.

Some of the projects that I am actively involved are:

* [Eclipse Dirigible](https://www.dirigible.io/)
* [XSK](https://www.xsk.io/)
* [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/)



Every post in this blog reflects my own opinion only.
