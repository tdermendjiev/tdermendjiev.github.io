My name is Teodor Dermendjiev and I am a software engineer, interested in runtimes, cybersecurity and privacy. I hold a master degree in law from Sofia University and care a lot about digital human rights. 

Some of the projects that I am actively involved are:

* [Eclipse Dirigible](https://www.dirigible.io/)
* [XSK](https://www.xsk.io/)
* [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/)



Every post in this blog reflects my own opinion only.
